# Andrei Rovnyiw

### Founder. Inventor. Creator.

![](/andrei_rovnyi.png "Andrei Rovnyi")

Hello, fellow human! I'm Andrei Rovnyi, a software sorcerer with over 13 years of experience, leading teams and building robust systems.

Currently, I wield my code powers as a full-stack developer at Gaijin Entertainment, helping launch massive games like War Thunder, Crossout and each other while also development Web-apps. When I'm not leading the charge in the digital battlefield, Iâ€™m crafting game mechanics or experimenting with new tech.

I won't cast love spells, but if you're looking for someone to magically optimize systems or create game-changing solutions, I'm your wizard!
