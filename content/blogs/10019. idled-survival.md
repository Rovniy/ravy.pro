### The Journey of Creating IDLED Survival: Stages, Challenges, and Solutions

Creating a game is always a unique adventure. Today, I want to share the story behind the development of [IDLED Survival](https://t.me/idled_survival) — from the first lines of code to the fully realized game world. I'll talk about the stages, the difficulties, and how we overcame them.

### Stage 1: Idea and Concept

It all started with a simple yet ambitious idea: to create an engaging game where players feel a sense of progress every step of the way. I aimed to combine dynamic battles with a collection mechanic so that every gaming session would be enjoyable.

The core principle of the concept was interaction with the environment and the use of collectible cards. These cards provided not only visual variety but also strategic depth. Thanks to the system of random buffs, each session became unique. This required careful planning and constant testing: how the cards interact with different types of enemies, how the player experiences growth in strength and challenge.

In addition to gameplay mechanics, it was important to identify the target audience. We focused on players who enjoy combining dynamic combat with strategy. This direction shaped many aspects of the game's design.

### Stage 2: Prototyping

Prototyping was the foundation on which the entire game was built. In the very beginning, I chose JavaScript to quickly create a prototype. This allowed us to promptly test the main game elements: character movement, basic attacks, and interactions with enemies.

The first version was minimalist — a simple interface and primitive graphics. The main goal was to check how the game feels in the player's hands. For example, the attack animations and character movement speed were constantly adjusted until we found the perfect balance.

Prototyping also highlighted the importance of optimization. Even in the early stages, the game showed performance issues, especially on mobile devices. This made us consider more complex architectural solutions for the next stage.

### Stage 3: Game Design

Game design was perhaps the most labor-intensive stage of development. We faced balancing challenges related to creating buffs and power-ups. At this stage, we developed a comprehensive system of game elements, including collectible cards, rare buffs, and unique abilities.

Each buff in the game was designed as a unique tool to help the player. However, the challenge was ensuring that no buff became too powerful. We repeatedly adjusted the characteristics and rarity of the cards to achieve the perfect balance. Additional attention was given to the progression system: each session had to deliver tangible rewards while also encouraging purchases through the in-game shop.

During this period, analytics became an essential tool. We implemented a tracking system to understand how players use buffs and which gameplay elements needed improvement. This allowed us not only to refine the balance but also to make the game more engaging.

### Stage 4: Visual Style

The visual component played a key role in creating [IDLED Survival](https://t.me/idled_survival). We chose a cartoony style with bright colors and dynamic elements. This decision helped make the game appealing to a broad audience, including casual players.

For creating characters and monsters, we used Figma and specialized graphic editors. Every design element — from attack animations to buff effects — was developed with user experience in mind. For example, monsters were designed to be easily distinguishable in the chaos of battle, and the interface was made to be intuitive and functional.

Special attention was given to adapting graphics for mobile devices. We tested the game on various screens to ensure that elements displayed correctly and retained their readability even on small devices.

### Stage 5: Technical Solutions

The technical side of the project was a real challenge. For the game's frontend, we chose Vue 3 and TypeScript, which allowed us to use a modern tech stack and create a scalable architecture.

A custom game engine became the foundation for implementing all game mechanics. This solution enabled us to dive deep into optimization and better understand the specifics of working with high-load systems. For instance, we implemented our own algorithms for collision detection and damage calculation to ensure game stability even with a large number of enemies on the screen.

A Telegram bot built on Node.js using Telegraf became an important part of community interaction. Through the bot, players could receive notifications, participate in polls, and share their achievements. This helped strengthen our connection with the audience and improve feedback.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Optimization:** Lags in the later stages of the game revealed the need to redesign the architecture. We implemented simplified shaders, reworked animations, and added support for multithreaded computations. This significantly reduced device load.
- **Monetization:** Developing a purchasing system required fine-tuning. We found a balance between voluntary investments and the sense of reward for playing. Players can acquire rare buffs and cards through purchases but also have the opportunity to progress without investments.
- **Community:** We actively engage with the community through Telegram, conduct polls, and discuss updates. This helps us better understand player expectations and adjust the development of the project.

### Conclusion

Developing [IDLED Survival](https://t.me/idled_survival) was a test of our skills and creative approach. We put our best ideas into the game to provide players with a unique experience. Each stage, from the initial concepts to final optimization, became part of this journey.
