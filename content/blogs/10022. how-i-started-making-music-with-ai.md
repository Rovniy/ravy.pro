### 🎸 How I Started Making Music with AI — And Why I Can’t Stop Now

At the end of 2024, I stumbled upon a startup called [Suno](https://suno.com/) — and something just clicked. Suddenly, I realized: I can create the kind of music *I* want to listen to. I don’t need permission, I don’t need a label. I just need the will to do it. That was the moment everything came together.

### The First Step — Zynthar

My first track was released under the name **[Zynthar](https://zynthar.rocks/)**. It wasn’t just "some heavy stuff" — it was mine. A raw, emotional, powerful sound, echoing the bands that shaped me as a listener: *Rammstein*, *Linkin Park*, *Korol i Shut*, *Aria*, *Manowar*…

Early on, I decided to work like a full-on producer of a music universe. I launched a few concept projects — **Dusty Cassette**, a lo-fi indie trio with a nostalgic vibe, and **Void Tapes**, an anonymous techno act. But they didn’t really resonate with the audience.

**[Zynthar](https://zynthar.rocks/)** and **[Diva Rogue](https://divarogue.com/)**? They hit different. People listened. People *felt* something. And I knew: *this is it.*

### Zynthar and Diva Rogue — Two Sides of My Soul

**[Zynthar](https://zynthar.rocks/)** is the sound of conflict. It’s the embodiment of inner chaos, pain, release, and hope. Screaming into the void with guitars, massive drums, and lyrics pulled from real moments in my life. It’s not music for attention — it’s music for survival.

**[Diva Rogue](https://divarogue.com/)**, on the other hand, is pure vibe. The sound of city nights. Sensual, stylish, confident. You hear her songs and feel like you’re cruising through neon-lit streets or sitting in a candlelit lounge with something on the rocks. It’s sexy, smooth, but still driven.

### I’m Not a Musician — I’m a Movement

I don’t call myself a “musician” in the traditional sense. I don’t play ten instruments. But I know exactly what I’m doing. In an era of generative AI, I’m creating a **new wave** of music — digital artists who *feel* real, sound real, and connect like humans.

What drives me is the process itself. I re-listen to my own tracks — not out of ego, but because they finally feel like something I’ve always wanted to hear. That’s the rush.

### I Want Zynthar in Rock Bars, and Diva Rogue in Every Chill Café

I’m not just releasing songs into the void. I want **Zynthar and Diva Rogue to become household names**. I want people to argue over who’s better. I want TikToks made with **[Zynthar](https://zynthar.rocks/)** breakdowns and lo-fi playlists drifting with **[Diva Rogue](https://divarogue.com/)** vocals.

I want someone to hear a song and say, “Damn… this is *exactly* how I feel.”
